When faced with obstacles of large magnitudes, a larger start-up driving force is required to execute such tasks. It is incredibly difficult to begin something for which we can not even start or desire to start because of the size of it. The same can be said about task completion.

>You can't finish what you don't start. [1]

Someone's driving force to begin working must be greater than the size of the task itself, otherwise they will never be able to complete it. The term for this is called **resistance.** This concept of resistance is a direction filled with friction; There is a task to be done but there exists several things in the way that are preventing one from doing so.

Merriam Webster defines resistance as, "an act or instance of resisting". The definition of resisting is "to exert force in opposition". In the world of physics, resistance is "an opposing or impeding force" which holds true in this case. [3]
